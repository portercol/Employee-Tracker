## Description
Build a command-line application that allows the user to manage their company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. At a minium the user should be able to;
    1. View all departments, roles and employees.
    2. Add new departments, roles and employees.
    3. Update existing employee roles.

## How it works
    1. Build out schema.sql and seed.sql to pre-populate the database.
    2. Use the MySQL NPM package to connect to MySQL database and perform queries.
    3. Use InquirerJs NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.
    4. Use console.table to print MySQL rows to the console.
